##  Perfect For

**Combat Encounters**  
Design dynamic battle music: *Tension intro* → *combat loop* → *victory fanfare*

**Any Music Track**  
Ever find music you love but with annoying parts? Create segment loops to play only the sections you enjoy.

**Taverns & Social Hubs**  
Layer ambient loops: *Base ambience* → *crowd chatter* → *bardic performance*

**Exploration & Dungeons**  
Create evolving atmospheres that never feel repetitive with randomized silence and multi-segment loops

**Boss Battles**  
Build multi-phase soundscapes: *Phase 1 theme* → *Enraged phase 2* → *Defeat/victory*

**Narrative Moments**  
Fade between emotional beats with professional crossfades

## Feature Overview

###  **Advanced Looping**

#### Internal Loop-Within-Sound
Create professional game audio structures:
- Define **start and end timestamps** for seamless loop segments
- Set **loop counts** (play 3 times, then continue) or loop infinitely
- Configure **crossfade duration** between loop iterations (default: 1000ms)
- **Multi-segment support:** Chain multiple loop regions in a single track
- Uses **equal-power crossfades** to avoid jarring loop transitions
- **Preview your segments** and fades between audio loops quickly and easily with a built-in audio previewer and **seek bar**

#### Skip Intro Feature
- Start playback directly at your first loop segment
- Perfect for ambient tracks where you want instant atmosphere
- Applies configurable fade-in at the loop point

#### Flexible Segment Behavior
- **Skip to Next:** Jump to the next segment after completing loops
- **Play Through:** Let audio continue naturally after the loop
- **Graceful Retirement:** Automatically fades out at track end when loops complete

---

###  **Dynamic Playback**

#### Configurable Silence Gaps
- Insert pauses between tracks to simulate natural music flow
- **Static mode:** Fixed duration (e.g., always 5 seconds)
- **Random mode:** Randomize within a range (e.g., 3-10 seconds)
- Perfect for preventing listener fatigue

#### Automatic Crossfading
- Seamlessly blend between tracks using equal-power crossfades
- Respects your playlist's fade duration settings or use your own
- Works with manual skips and automatic progression
- Synchronized perfectly across all connected clients

#### Intelligent Fade-In
- Smoothly ramps up volume when tracks start as part of a logarithmic fade.
- Configurable per-playlist
- Uses exponential curves for natural-sounding volume changes

---

###  **Playlist Management**

- **Loop Entire Playlist** — Automatically restart in Sequential, Shuffle, or Simultaneous modes
- **Volume Normalization** — Set a target volume for all tracks with per-sound overrides
- **GM Authority System** — Prevents conflicts when multiple GMs are online
- **Mode Coordination** — Smart behavior: Crossfade mode automatically overrides Silence mode

---

###  **Integrated UI**

#### Playlist Header Toggles
-  **Enable Silence** — Quick toggle for gap injection
-  **Auto-Crossfade** — One-click seamless transitions
-  **Loop Entire Playlist** — Shows as green underline + shuffle icon when active

#### Per-Sound Controls
-  **Orange circle icon** — Toggle internal looping without opening config

#### Configuration Dialogs
- **Playlist Config:** Fade-in, silence settings, crossfade toggle, volume normalization
- **Sound Config:** Multi-segment loop editor with visual timeline, crossfade settings, intro skip option

##  Installation

### Method 1: From Foundry VTT (Recommended)
1. In Foundry, go to **Add-on Modules** → **Install Module**
2. Search for **"The Sound of Silence"**
3. Click **Install**

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Copy this manifest URL:
   ```
   https://github.com/Somedude5/The-Sound-of-Silence/releases/latest/download/module.json
   ```
2. In Foundry, go to **Add-on Modules** → **Install Module**
3. Paste the URL in the **Manifest URL** field
4. Click **Install**

##  Usage Guide

### Basic Setup

1. **Configure Playlist Settings**
   - Right-click playlist → **Configure**
   - Set **Fade-In Duration** (global for all sounds in this playlist)
   - Choose **Silence Mode** (static or random) and duration
   - Enable **Loop Entire Playlist** if desired
  
2. **You can turn these On or Off at will**
   - Open the **Playlist Directory**
   - Click the toggle buttons in any playlist header:
     - ⌛ = Silence Gaps
     - 🔀 = Auto-Crossfade
     - 🔁 = Loop Playlist

3. **Set Up Internal Loops** (Optional)
   - Right-click any sound → **Configure**
   - Enable **Internal Looping**
   - Add segments with start/end times
   - Set crossfade duration and loop counts

### Advanced: Multi-Segment Loops

**Example: Boss Battle Music**
```
Segment 1: 00:00 - 01:30 (Intro, loop 1x, skip to next)
Segment 2: 01:30 - 03:00 (Phase 1, loop infinitely)
Segment 3: 03:00 - 04:45 (Phase 2, loop infinitely) 
Segment 4: 04:45 - 06:00 (Victory, loop 1x, play through)
```

**How it works:**
1. Track plays intro once
2. Automatically jumps to Phase 1 loop
3. Manually break loop when boss enters Phase 2 by clicking the white icon in the UI
4. Track jumps to Phase 2 loop
5. Break loop again when boss defeated → victory music plays once → track ends

## 🔒 Important Notes

### Feature Interactions
- ⚠️ **Crossfade and Silence are mutually exclusive** — Enabling crossfade automatically disables silence (by design for clean transitions)
- ⚠️ **Pause disabled during crossfades** — Prevents audio glitches during internal loop transitions (technical limitation)

### Performance Considerations
- **Memory efficient:** Module uses dual-buffer architecture — only 2 sound instances loaded regardless of segment count
- **Long audio files (15+ minutes):** May cause 1-2 second delays during initial loop setup due to audio decoding
  - The module reuses buffers efficiently, so subsequent loops are instant
  - Consider using shorter files or Opus/OGG format for faster decoding
- **WeakMap state storage:** Automatically garbage collected, prevents memory leaks during long sessions
- **Audio-thread scheduling:** All fades run on Foundry's dedicated audio context, zero main-thread impact

## 🗺️ Roadmap

###  Future Considerations
- [ ] Cross-playlist crossfading, fade from Exploration → Combat playlists
- [ ] Intro → Playlist linking, play intro track, then auto-switch to looping playlist
- [ ] Preset system (save/load/share loop configurations)
- [ ] Playlist automation triggers (conditions: "on combat start", "on scene change")
- [ ] API expansion for macro/module integration
- [ ] Building out the Performance profiler and diagnostics dashboard more
- [ ] Ability to Play Loop Segments in any Order, so go from segment one from 1:00-1:45 to a segment at 00:20-00:40

## For Developers

### Architecture Highlights
This module implements professional game audio patterns:

- **Web Audio API** for sample-accurate timing
- **Dual-buffer crossfading** system (soundA/soundB architecture)
- **WeakMap-based state management** for automatic garbage collection
- **Audio-thread scheduling** via AudioContext.currentTime
- **Exponential curves** for perceptually-linear volume changes
- **Equal-power crossfades** (sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 for constant perceived power)

### Public API

The module exposes a public API for advanced users:

```javascript
// Access via game.modules.get("the-sound-of-silence").api

// Inspect current state
const state = game.modules.get("the-sound-of-silence").api.inspectAll();
console.log(state); // Shows active loopers, crossfades, silence gaps

// Open diagnostics window
game.modules.get("the-sound-of-silence").api.openDiagnostics();

// Get performance metrics
const metrics = game.modules.get("the-sound-of-silence").api.getMetrics();
console.log(metrics.crossfades.total); // Total crossfades since module load
```
